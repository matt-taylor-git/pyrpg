# Enhanced Gameplay Features PRD

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the RPG game by adding more activities and control options through the GUI to make gameplay more interesting and engaging for casual gamers. Currently, the game has limited player activities and control options, leading to shorter play sessions. The enhanced gameplay introduces character customization, monster information viewing, save/load functionality, detailed stats viewing, and rest/heal mechanics.

## Goals

1. Increase player engagement by 30% through additional interactive features
2. Provide players with more control over their character and game state
3. Make the game more interesting for casual gamers through varied activities
4. Extend average session time from current levels to at least 15-20 minutes
5. Maintain game balance and existing core mechanics

## User Stories

**As a casual gamer:**
- I want to customize my character's appearance so I can personalize my playthrough
- I want to view detailed stats about my character so I can track my progress
- I want to view monster information before combat so I can make informed strategic decisions
- I want to save and load my game progress so I can play in multiple sessions
- I want to rest/heal between adventures so I can recover without constant pressure
- I want more control over various game aspects to feel more invested in my gameplay

## Functional Requirements

1. **Character Customization System:** Players must be able to change their character's appearance, name, and cosmetic elements through a dedicated GUI interface accessible from the main menu or character screen.

2. **Monster Stats Viewer:** Players must be able to view detailed statistics and abilities of monsters they encounter, including health, attacks, weaknesses, and descriptions.

3. **Save/Load Game Functionality:** Players must be able to save their current game state at any time and load previously saved games through a persistent save system.

4. **Detailed Player Stats Display:** Players must be able to view comprehensive statistics about their character, including but not limited to: damage dealt, enemies defeated, items collected, time played, and achievements unlocked.

5. **Rest/Heal Mechanic:** Players must be able to use a rest action that allows their character to recover health and resources, with appropriate time costs or penalties to maintain game balance.

6. **Enhanced Game Controls:** Players must have improved control over game settings, character management options, and decision-making processes through expanded GUI interfaces.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Major changes to combat mechanics or battle system
- Multiplayer features or networking capabilities
- New game modes or significant story changes
- Mobile platform compatibility
- Advanced modding/creation tools for users

## Design Considerations

The new features should integrate seamlessly with the existing PySide/Qt-based GUI using consistent styling and navigation patterns. All new interfaces should follow the established design language with appropriate use of the existing components (status indicators, validation labels, etc.). New screens should be accessible through the existing tab-based navigation system where appropriate.

## Technical Considerations

- Save/load functionality should use JSON serialization for game state persistence
- Character customization should integrate with existing character creation system
- Monster stats should be accessible during adventure and combat phases
- Rest/heal mechanic should integrate with existing game timing and resource systems
- All new features should work with the existing game models and controllers

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric:** Average player session time increases by at least 50%
- Players regularly use at least 3 of the 5 new features per session
- No negative impact on game performance or stability
- Positive user feedback through in-game satisfaction indicators
- Reduced player drop-off rate in mid-game progression

## Open Questions

- Should character customization persist across saves or reset on new games?
- What specific monster stats should be displayed (attack patterns, weaknesses, etc.)?
- How frequently should save autosave function (every combat, every room change, manual only)?
- What are the balance costs/mechanics for the rest/heal feature?
- Should there be a limit to how many save slots are available?
